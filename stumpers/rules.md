# ðŸ“• Rules

During this exam, it is **mandatory** that you respect these rules. Any cheat of any sort will be resulted by a **-42** grade. Beware!

These are the rules:

* No communications, at all! If you have any questions you must raise your hand and wait.
* Don't use internet, no web browser, no requests at all.
* You have to be on **TTY** mode. (see ...)
* Before the exam your computer will be checked for any cheats, like "norminettes" or already prepared stumper subjects. If it appears that you have any of the above it'll be considered as cheating.

{% hint style="info" %}
Although preparing future subjects is not allowed, you still have access to all your other projects (even your previous stumpers).
