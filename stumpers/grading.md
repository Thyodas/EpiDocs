# ğŸ“ˆ Grading

{% hint style="danger" %}
This part is really important as it lists everything you have to do to avoid any surprise during your stumper.
{% endhint %}

Solo stumpers are only graded by the automated tests. If you pass 15/20 tests you pass the stumper and you'll be eligible to take duo stumpers.

Duo stumpers are graded by the automated tests too. If you pass 15/20 tests you are eligible for the defense that takes place after the exam. This page will help you pass this defense as it can be sometimes tricky.
