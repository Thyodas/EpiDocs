# ‚ùì What are stumpers?

Stumpers are tests that you must pass during your first year at EPITECH.\
There will be 2 stumpers, a **Solo stumper** and a **Duo stumper.**

Stumpers will test your skills with a variety of subject. During those stumpers you'll not be able to use the Internet nor use the graphical interface. In fact you'll be using what is called **TTY** : an interface with only a terminal that takes the whole screen.
